## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

## Key Concepts

### Software Versions
Software versions are parsed from vendor designations and include:
- Version number (e.g., "V2R4M0" or "2.4.0")
- PTF level (e.g., "PTF12345" or "SP1")

### Packages
Packages are collections of software products tested and deployed together:
- Include all software the service provider is responsible for
- Customers receive relevant subsets of the package
- Each LPAR can be assigned to a specific package level

### Rollback
Individual software products can be rolled back if issues occur:
- Previous version is tracked
- Rollback history is maintained
- Does not affect other software in the package

## Development Notes

- TODO markers indicate where database integration is needed
- Mock data is currently used in +page.server.ts files
- API routes can be added in src/routes/api/
- Validation schemas should be kept in sync with types

## Database Integration

To integrate a database:

1. Add your database library (e.g., Prisma, Drizzle, etc.)
2. Update the mock data in +page.server.ts files
3. Implement actual CRUD operations
4. Add authentication and authorization
5. Implement audit logging
