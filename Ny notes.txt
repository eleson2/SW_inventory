README notes TODO: many +page.server.ts files currently use mock data.

Prisma is present but not fully integrated in route handlers.



No import features (CSV/Excel) or connectors to discover installed 

software from systems. For inventory at scale, automated discovery 

or import is useful.

UX polish and data volume handling



Wire up Prisma and replace mock data in route handlers (+page.server.ts) 

with real DB queries; 

add basic seeds (prisma/seed.ts exists).
