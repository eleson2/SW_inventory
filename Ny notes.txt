README notes TODO: many +page.server.ts files currently use mock data. \nPrisma is present but not fully integrated in route handlers.\n\nNo import features (CSV/Excel) or connectors to discover installed \nsoftware from systems. For inventory at scale, automated discovery \nor import is useful.\n\nUX polish and data volume handling\n\n\nWire up Prisma and replace mock data in route handlers (+page.server.ts) \nwith real DB queries; \nadd basic seeds (prisma/seed.ts exists).\n\n\n\n\n
