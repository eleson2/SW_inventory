Target is to build a Software inventory system for mainframe lpars in a multi tenant environment with multiple customers.
Only need basic Customer info.
Only need basic Vendor info

Software's shall have a version and ptf level and tha shall be possible to extrzct from vendors designations. 
Software is deistributed both as individual products and as packages.
A package set of products that is well tested together and rolled out together. 
A package includes all or almost all software's that the service provider is responsible for 
but a customer only receeives the software's that are relevant for them, is a subset of the package. 

It must be possible to say that an lpar is on a certain package level.
It must be possible to roll back individual products is case there is a problem.
